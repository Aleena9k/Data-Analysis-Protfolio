### Sales Trends

- The overall Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) was recorded at $10,631,048.74, with November 2011 contributing approximately $1.5M, accounting for 14.11% of the total sales during the period from December 2010 to December 2011.
  
- The sales exhibited a steady upward trend starting from August 2011, peaking in November 2011, followed by a sharp decline in December 2011. It is obsereved that **DOTCOM POSTAGE** gave the highest revenue during this period suggesting that a large number of people ordered stuff online. The top physical product which made high sales is **Rabbit Night Light.**
  
- Between December 2010 and February 2011, sales experienced a notable decline, likely due to post-holiday season effects and reduced customer engagement. However, sales began to recover gradually from March 2011, maintaining steady growth through the mid-year months.

### Product Analysis

- The highest revenue was generated by “DOTCOM POSTAGE” (£206,248.77), followed by “REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER” (£174,156.54) and “PAPER CRAFT, LITTLE BIRDIE” (£168,469.60). Most top-performing products were decorative or packaging items, reflecting strong demand in the home décor and event merchandise categories.
- The analysis indicates that a small set of products contributes significantly to overall revenue — a common pattern in e-commerce where bestsellers drive the majority of sales. This insight is valuable for inventory and marketing strategy optimization.
- The top 10 products contributed approximately 10.8% of the total revenue, indicating a well-diversified product portfolio. While this suggests reduced dependency on individual items, it also highlights potential opportunities to identify high-margin or high-demand products for strategic promotion.
