## Executive Summary


## Insights and findings

### Sales Analysis
- **Gross Merchendise Value (GMV)** - The total revenue generated from all sales transactions amounted to **$10,631,048.74**, reflecting the overall scale of business activity and serving as a key indicator of marketplace performance.
  
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: The global average AOV was **$532.64**, with significant variation across regions. The highest AOVs were recorded in **Singapore ($3,039.90)** and **Netherlands ($3,036.66)**, indicating strong bulk purchasing behavior in these markets. Countries such as Australia and Japan also showed higher-than-average AOVs, suggesting a focus on high-value orders or wholesale transactions. In contrast, domestic sales in the **United Kingdom** had an AOV of **$498.98**, reflecting smaller but more frequent purchases.
This regional analysis highlights how international customers tend to place larger orders, while UK-based buyers exhibit steady, lower-value transactions, aligning with the dataset’s wholesale nature.

- **Monthly Sales Trends** - It was observed that the highest sales occurred in **November 2011**, reaching approximately $1.5M, while the lowest sales were recorded in **February 2011** at around $0.52M. The sales exhibited a steady upward trend starting from August 2011, peaking in November 2011, followed by a sharp decline in December 2011. Additionally, there was a consistent drop from December 2010 to February 2011, whereas the period between May 2011 and August 2011 showed relatively stable sales performance.

### Product Analysis

- **Top 10 Products by Sales** - The highest revenue was generated by “DOTCOM POSTAGE” (£206,248.77), followed by “REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER” (£174,156.54) and “PAPER CRAFT, LITTLE BIRDIE” (£168,469.60). Most top-performing products were decorative or packaging items, reflecting strong demand in the home décor and event merchandise categories.The analysis indicates that a small set of products contributes significantly to overall revenue — a common pattern in e-commerce where bestsellers drive the majority of sales. This insight is valuable for inventory and marketing strategy optimization.
